                <div class="content-body">
                    <p>Mission Anabaino emerged from a thirty-plus year
                        post-Christendom context in North America, specifically
                        New England - arguably the
                        "least religious region of North America." In this
                        environment, our deepest convictions are often not
                        acknowledged or respected. The words "God" and "Church"
                        are frequently treated as relics of the past.</p>

                    <h2 class="heading-2">The Need for a New Kind of Church</h2>
                    <p>Yes, like other post-Christendom places, our birthing
                        grounds of New England are desperate for more churches.
                        But even more so, post-Christendom places need a
                        "new kind" of church! This has become MA's area of
                        expertise. Over the years, it was discovered that the
                        Christendom-model of planting churches most common in
                        our denominational contexts was just not adequate. It
                        often led to disillusionment and false expectations for
                        our church planters. It also failed to reflect a
                        strategy suitable to truly "scratch" plants.</p>

                    <h2 class="heading-2">Our Response</h2>
                    <p>We recognize the need for not just more churches, but a
                        "new kind" of church that can effectively engage with
                        and minister to a post-Christendom society. Our approach
                        involves:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rediscovering the sacred first principles of the
                            apostolic missionary church</li>
                        <li>Translating these principles into social liturgies
                            that address post-modernity challenges</li>
                        <li>Reconstructing the pre-modern, apostolic church for
                            a post-Christendom context</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Developing contextually appropriate church planting
                            models</li>
                        <li>Training leaders in post-Christendom ministry
                            approaches</li>
                        <li>Fostering communities that engage meaningfully with
                            contemporary culture</li>
                        <li>Emphasizing the relevance of the gospel in a
                            pluralistic society</li>
