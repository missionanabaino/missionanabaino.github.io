            <h2>Become a Planter</h2>
            <p>At Mission Anabaino, we believe that during His ascension
                ministry today, Christ has an address at every place where there
                is an apostolic, Christ-centered church. Mission Anabaino
                consist of a growing number of affiliate churches and partners
                wherein MA is gathering, energizing, deploying, and focusing our
                resources into a collaborative effort to plant churches where
                Christ's saving presence is not readily accessible especially
                targeting post-christendom places.

            <h2>Become an Anchor Church</h2>
            <p>MA was initially blessed by God through Christ Presbyterian
                Church, New Haven with $3.5 million venture capital with a
                vision to plant 10 church in Southern CT, 10 Chuch Globally in
                TEN YEARS! Going on nine years, MA has to date being enabled to
                plant 24 churches and is planning for at least two more in
                Southern Connecticut. At the same time, more and more church
                planters from around the country, and even the world, are
                contacting us, seeking to become theological collaborators in
                misisonal ecclesiology and church planters with Mission
                Anabaino.
            </p>
            <p>In light of these developments, we launching MA 2.0. MA 2.0 will
                become a 501 (c)(3) organization governed and supported by a
                network of member churches and supported by anchor churches. We
                are currently seeking to recruite potential Member and Anchor
                Churches who share the MA theological vision and missional call
                to plant church suitable to post-Christian and spiritually
                frontier regions of the world- MA's specialty.
