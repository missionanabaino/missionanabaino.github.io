        <h1>MA Apprentice Readings in Missional Ecclesiology</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>After Christendom, WHAT? A Course in Missional Ecclesiology</h2>
            <p>Playing off of Thomas Odens' "After Modernity, What?" this course wants to ask the same question as related to modernity generally, but as it is specifically related to the church per missional ecclesiology. The thesis begins with the assertion that Christendom is fundamentally in a syncretistic relationship between "modernity" and Christianity—e.g., Christendom.</p>
            <p>The task here is to all out re-think "church" at three levels, and in that order:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>What The Church IS In Relation To Christ:</strong> The Ontological Question as to what the church is fundamentally (elementally). e.g., The Church is Totus Christus as both the mediatorial manifestation of Covenant and Temple.</li>
                <li><strong>How The Church Is Discovered in Relation To Christ:</strong> The Epistemological Question e.g., The church as the mediatorial presence of the Triplex Vocational endeavor of Christ as Prophet, Priest, King.</li>
                <li><strong>How The Church Is Formed in Relation To A Local Context:</strong> The Teleological Question as to becoming the flesh of a particular people and place as the strategic level.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In other words, to answer the church question in relation to both Christ and the World, we must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>De-Construct The Christendom (Modernist) Church—What the Church IS</li>
                <li>Re-Construction the Redemptive Historical Apostolic Church—What the Church Does</li>
                <li>Re-Form the Apostolic Church Into a Post-Christendom Flesh—How the Church Does what it does in a way that is local as to convey best what it is and accomplish what it does.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a course in "missional" ecclesiology, it will be shown that the church, by its nature as the mediatorial existential presence of Christ is Missional, by its vocation as Christ's mediated vocational presence as prophet, priest, and shepherd-king is Missional, and by its mystical union with Christ flesh in heaven and the people's flesh on earth in the "form" of a particular people and place is Missional.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"The church is not the source of witness, it is the locus of witness…. The presence of a new reality, the presence in the shared life of the church of the spirit…" - Lesslie Newbigin</p>
                <p>"Just as we insist that a Church which has ceased to be a mission has lost the essential character of a Church, so must we also say that a mission which is not at the same time truly a Church is not a true expression of the divine apostolate. An unchurchly mission is as much a monstrosity as an unmissionary church." - Lesslie Newbigin</p>
            </blockquote>
