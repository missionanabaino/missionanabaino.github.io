            <h2>Plant a Church</h2>
            <p>At Mission Anabaino, we believe that during His ascension
                ministry today, Christ has an address at every place where there
                is an apostolic, Christ-centered church. Mission Anabaino
                consist of a growing number of affiliate churches and partners
                wherein MA is gathering, energizing, deploying, and focusing our
                resources into a collaborative effort to plant churches where
                Christ’s saving presence is not readily accessible especially
                targeting post-christendom places.
            </p>

            <h2>What Kind of Church?</h2>
            <h4>The "Five Marks" and the Celebration of "BOTH-AND"
                Ecclesiology!</h4>
            <p>Total Christ spirituality seeks to resist the “either-or”
                pendulum swings that have too commonly plagued modern
                Christianity. Reuniting both a covenantal and temple
                spirituality, Total Christ is both “high gospel" and
                "high church" ecclesiology. Reuniting Christ’s salvific offices
                of Prophet, Priest, and King, a “Total Christ” church is at once
                Confessional, Sacramental, and Governmental respectively.</p>
            <h4>In sum, then, we call this the "Five Marks" of a Total Christ
                Church:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gospel Centered:</strong> A Covenantal, “High
                    Gospel” Spirituality</li>
                <li><strong>Missional Presence:</strong> A Temple, “High Church”
                    Spirituality and Ecclesiology</li>
                <li><strong>Confessional / Belief-Centered:</strong> Christ Our
                    Prophet</li>
                <li><strong>Sacramental:</strong> Christ Our Priest</li>
                <li><strong>Governed Communal:</strong> Christ Our King</li>
