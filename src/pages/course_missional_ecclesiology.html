    <h1>After Christendom, WHAT?</h1>
    <h2>A Course in Missional Ecclesiology</h2>
    <p>Course Description:</p>
Playing off of Thomas Odens' "After Modernity, What?" this course wants to ask the same question as related to modernity generally, but as it is specifically related to the church per missional ecclesiology.  The thesis begins with the assertion that Christendom is fundamantally in a syncretistic relationshsip between "modernity" and Christian--e.g Christendom.   
    </p>
    <p>The task here is to all out re-think "church" at three levels, and in that order.   
    </p>
    <p>What The Church IS In Relation To Christ-- The Ontological Question as to what the church is fundamenetally (elementally). e.g The Church is Totus Christus as both the mediatorial manifestion of Covenant and Temple
    </p>
    <p>How The Church Is Discovered in Relation To Christ: The Epistomological Question e.g. The church as the mediatorial presence of the Triplex Vocational endeavor of Christ as Prophet, Priest, King
    </p>
    <p>How The Church Is Formed in Relation To A Local Context:  The Teleological Question as to becoming the flesh of a particular people and place as the strategic level. 
    </p>

    <p>In other words, To answer the church question in relation to both Christ and the World, we must   

        De-Construct The Christendom (Modernist) Church--What the Church IS
        Re-Construction the Redemptive Historical Apostolic Church--What the Church Does 
        Re-Form  the Apostlic Church Into a Post-Christendom Flesh-How the Church Does what it does in a way that is local as to convey best what it is and aaccomplish what it does.   </p>
