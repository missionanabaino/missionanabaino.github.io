        "title": "MA Apprentice Readings in Missional Ecclesiology",
        "description": "Designed for Mission Anabaino's Church Planting Apprenticeship Training, these readings seek to construct a missional ecclesiology in conversation with reformed catholicity, together with its practical relevance to contemporary issues and ministry. The various topics are studied as an investigation in ascension Christology applied, or Augustineâ€™s Totus Christus thesis through the reformed trajectory and qualifications. The ecclesiology espoused is a 'Five Mark' Church ('High Gospel,' 'High Ecclesia,' Confessional, Sacramental, and Communal)."

        "title": "Confessional Theology",
        "description": "The primary aim of this course in confessional theology is to assist the student (seeker and/or believer) in constructing the kind of holistic worldview that is thoroughly informed by what the Christian scriptures principally teach. Our method is confessional. The confessional method is distinguished from systematic, historical, philosophical, or even social theologies, while also sharing in some elements inherent to each of them. It is at the end an exercise of faith formation within a communal context. Our primary source will be the Westminster Standards (the Confession of Faith together with the Larger and Shorter Catechisms), one historic expression of the catholic faith."
