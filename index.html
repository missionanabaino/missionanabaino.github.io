                    </div>
                    <div class="content-body">
                        <p>Mission Anabaino emerged from a thirty-plus year
                            post-Christendom context in North America,
                            specifically
                            New England - arguably the
                            "least religious region of North America." In this
                            environment, our deepest convictions are often not
                            acknowledged or respected. The words "God" and
                            "Church"
                            are frequently treated as relics of the past.

                            <p>Yes, like other post-Christendom places, our
                                birthing
                                grounds of New England are desperate for more
                                churches. But even more so, post-Christendom
                                places
                                need a "new kind" of church! This has become
                                MA's
                                area of expertise. Over the years, it was
                                discovered
                                that the Christendom-model of planting churches
                                most
                                common in our denominational contexts was just
                                not
                                adequate. It often led to disillusionment and
                                false
                                expectations for our church planters. It also
                                failed
                                to reflect a strategy suitable to truly
                                "scratch"
                                plants.</p>

                            <h2>Our Response</h2>

                            <p>We recognize the need for not just more churches,
                                but
                                a "new kind" of church that can effectively
                                engage
                                with and minister to a post-Christendom society.
                                We
                                aim to rediscover the sacred first principles of
                                the
                                apostolic missionary church. We translate these
                                principles into social liturgies that address
                                post-modernity challenges. We reconstruct the
                                pre-modern, apostolic church for a
                                post-Christendom
