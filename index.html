			<h3>We Are a Church Planting Network:</h3>
			<p class="innerText">
				As a community of church planters, we are committed to strategically targeting sites representing
				post-Christian “frontiers” in need of a church planting movement informed by our "Total Christ," or
				"Five Mark," understanding of the church. MA is actively involved in defining and executing church
				planting strategy wherein by recruiting, assessing, funding, developing, encouraging, coaching and
				supporting church planters and interns, a church planting culture is cultivated and financial and other
				resources are allocated toward church planting. For more information about church planting with MA click

			<h1>our theological Vision.</h1>
			<p class="innerText">
				The term “Total Christ” originates from 5th century pastor-theologian Augustine of Hippo about the
				relationship of Christ’s incarnational ministry (past) to his ongoing ascension ministry (present).
				Applying John 1:14 to Eph.1:21-23 and 2:19ff, Augustine conclude

				The Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us; to that flesh is joined the church, and there is made
				total Christ, both head and body.</p>
			<p class="innerText">
				While holding to the “distinct but never separate” formula of Chalcedon Christology applied to the
				incarnation, the principle is therefore applied to the nature of the church as mediated by the Holy
				Spirit.

				The fullness of Christ, then, is head and members. Head and members, what is that? Christ and the
				Church!</p>
			<p class="innerText">
				St. Augustine, Homilies on the Gospel of John

				The entire MA project is informed by a theological vision inspired by Ascension Christology-Applied!
				Derived from a Christ-centered analysis in biblical theology, the church by divine institution and
				organization is envisioned to become Gods temple presence in local manifestations informed and governed
				by a Christo-centric divine covenant. The church as such is more than a gospel centered "best practice"
				or "philosophy of ministry," it is God's real and efficacious presence as then a topic in soteriology
				(salvation) as an essential element of the gospel.</p>
			<p class="innerText">
				More specifically, we discern that there was never a time in all of redemptive history when salvation
				was accomplished apart from a transaction of BOTH covenant (forensic grace accomplished by divine law)
				and temple (missional grace mediated by divine presence). The New Covenant gospels declare that Christ
				is both the Word (covenant head) and Temple (flesh-on-flesh presence), such as in John 1:14. These two
				aspects of Christ loomed large in the debates leading up to the Council of Chalcedon (word-Cyril and
				temple-Nestorius respectively), which resulted in the orthodox conclusion that one is always “distinct
				but never separate” from the other. We do not have access to Christ as Word without Christ as Temple,
				and vice versa.</p>
			<p class="innerText">
				As applied to Christ’s ascension ministry today, we seek to experience and practice the many
				implications that accompany Christ’s ministry as BOTH justifier (covenant head) AND missional power
				(temple presence), through a ministry that is BOTH “high gospel” (the good news of Christ's person and
				work) AND “high church” (the good news of Christ's mediated presence for salvation in our present age).
			</p>
			<p class="innerText">
				Sadly, to pit one emphasis against the other has contributed to schisms throughout church history --
				West vs. East, Transcendence vs. Immanence, "Teaching" churches vs. "Worship" churches vs. "Mercy
				Ministry" churches, and the many “either-or” pendulum swings represented in intra-mural debates
				denominationally. MA is dedicated to the "five marks," a spirituality that reunites (1) high gospel with
				(2) high church, so as to rediscover Christ as our (3) Prophet, (4) Priest, and (5) King.</p>

			<h1>What Kind of Churches</h1>
			<p class="innerText">
				The "Five Marks" and the Celebration of "BOTH-AND" Ecclesiology!
				Total Christ spirituality seeks to resist the “either-or” pendulum swings that has too commonly plagued
				modern Christianity. Reuniting both a covenantal and temple spirituality, Total Christ is both “high
				gospel" and "high church" ecclesiology. Reuniting Christ’s salvific offices of Prophet, Priest, and
				King, a “Total Christ” church is at once Confessional, Sacramental, and Governmental respectively. In
				sum, then, we call this the "Five Marks" of a Total Christ Church:
				In sum, then, we call this the "Five Marks" of a Total Christ Church:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Gospel Centered (A Covenantal, “High Gospel” Spirituality)</li>
				<li>Missional Presence (A Temple, “High Church” Spirituality and Ecclesiology)</li>
				<li>Confessional / Belief-Centered (Christ Our Prophet)</li>
				<li>Sacramental (Christ Our Priest)</li>
				<li>Governed Communal (Christ Our King)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="innerText">
				Mission Anabaino is mission “I am ascending” (Greek anabaino, cf. Jn. 20:17). As both a church planting
				network and theological collaborative, we exist in pursuit of the “greater things” that Christ
				envisioned for his ascension ministry wherein Christ's saving presence is mediated through the church in
				every place at the same time where a Total Christ church exists.
