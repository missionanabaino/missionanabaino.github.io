      <h2>...Bla Bla Bla</h2>
      <p>
        Ok, if you’re a little cynical about church planting networks
        you are not alone. While we believe that network activities are
        good and essential aspects of church planting, did you know that
        we are also a comprehensive planter-support community?
      </p>
      <p>
        MA was generated out of a thirty plus year post-Christendom
        context in North America that is arguably the “least religious
        region of North America.”[2] It is a place where, in the words
        of Stefan Pass, “ our deepest convictions were not acknowledged
        at all, or even respected... and we begin to realize how
        completely self-evident it is for the vast majority of those we
        encounter to live without God or the Church.” However much the
        words “God” and “Church” are still present, it was more often
        than not words relating to antiques or rare books.[3]
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, like other post-Christendom places, our birthing grounds of
        New England are desperate for more churches. But even more so,
        post-Christendom places need a “new kind” of church! This has
        become MA’s area of expertise. Over the years, it was discovered
        that the Christendom-model of planting churches most common in
        our denominational contexts was just not adequate. It often led
        to disillusionment and false expectations for our church
        planters. It also failed to reflect a strategy suitable to truly
        “scratch” plants.
      </p>
      <p>
        How then do we BOTH– rediscover the sacred first principles of
        the apostolic missionary church (forgotten in traditional
        Christendom) AND translate those into social liturgies and forms
        that speak to the circumstances and challenges of
        post-modernity? Rather than just “rethinking” strategy, forms
        and so called “philosophy of ministry,” we believe our task is
        to do the the much hard work of first deconstructing the
        Christendom-modernist “church” such as to then reconstruct the
        pre-modern, apostolic church in a way that can faithfully be
        translated into a post-Christendom context.” And we do all this
        while fostering a “band of brothers” support network that
        sustains us in our sacred calling together!

      <h2>In summary, MA wants to plant churches</h2>
      <p>
        But we also want to be
        an active collaborative in the re-discovery of WHAT the church
        IS by nature in relation to Christ as both our covenantal head
        and our temple presence in and through the local church! We call
        this our Total Christ, Five
        Marks vision in missional ecclesiology. To avoid the customary
        pendulum swings of “either-or” church strategy, we seek to
        answer two fundamental questions. First, what in redemptive
        history was always present and fulfilled by Christ as an
        essential element of the gospel and foundational to the
        missionary church? Second, and the all-important question in
        missional ecclesiology, how do these essential elements get
        formed during Christ’s ascension ministry as mediated in the
        “Body of Christ?”
      </p>
      <p>

        We hope this brief explanation of MA has encouraged you to read
        more about our Theological “Total Christ” vision and what we
        believe are the “Five Foundational Marks that become the metrics
        of a missionary local church.” It is a theological vision that
        we pray will bring substance to Lesslie Newbigin’s great
        declaration concerning the missionary nature of the church when
        he writes:

        <quote>
          The church is not the source of witness, it is the locus of
          witness.... The presence of a new reality, the presence in
          the shared life of the church of the spirit...[4]
