                    <h2>The Post-Christendom Challenge</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="content-body">
                    <p>Mission Anabaino emerged from a thirty-plus year
                        post-Christendom context in North America, specifically
                        New
                        England - arguably the
                        "least religious region of North America." In this
                        environment, our deepest convictions are often not
                        acknowledged or respected. The words "God" and "Church"
                        are
                        frequently treated as relics of the past.

                        <p>Yes, like other post-Christendom places, our birthing
                            grounds of New England are desperate for more
                            churches.
                            But even more so, post-Christendom places need a
                            "new
                            kind" of church! This has become MA's area of
                            expertise.
                            Over the years, it was discovered that the
                            Christendom-model of planting churches most common
                            in
                            our denominational contexts was just not adequate.
                            It
                            often led to disillusionment and false expectations
                            for
                            our church planters. It also failed to reflect a
                            strategy suitable to truly "scratch" plants.</p>

                        <h2>Our Response</h2>

                        <p>We recognize the need for not just more churches, but
                            a
                            "new kind" of church that can effectively engage
                            with
                            and minister to a post-Christendom society. We aim
                            to
                            rediscover the sacred first principles of the
                            apostolic
                            missionary church. We translate these principles
                            into
                            social liturgies that address post-modernity
                            challenges.
                            We reconstruct the pre-modern, apostolic church for
                            a
                            post-Christendom context.</p>

                                faithfully be translated into a post-Christendom
