                <h2>The Post-Christendom Challenge</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="content-body">
                <p>Mission Anabaino emerged from a thirty-plus year
                    post-Christendom context in North America, specifically New
                    England - arguably the
                    "least religious region of North America." In this
                    environment, our deepest convictions are often not
                    acknowledged or respected. The words "God" and "Church" are
                    frequently treated as relics of the past.

                    <p>Yes, like other post-Christendom places, our birthing
                        grounds of New England are desperate for more churches.
                        But even more so, post-Christendom places need a "new
                        kind" of church! This has become MA's area of expertise.
                        Over the years, it was discovered that the
                        Christendom-model of planting churches most common in
                        our denominational contexts was just not adequate. It
                        often led to disillusionment and false expectations for
                        our church planters. It also failed to reflect a
                        strategy suitable to truly "scratch" plants.</p>

                    <h2>Our Response</h2>

                    <p>We recognize the need for not just more churches, but a
                        "new kind" of church that can effectively engage with
                        and minister to a post-Christendom society. We aim to
                        rediscover the sacred first principles of the apostolic
                        missionary church. We translate these principles into
                        social liturgies that address post-modernity challenges.
                        We reconstruct the pre-modern, apostolic church for a
                        post-Christendom context.</p>

                                faithfully be translated into a post-Christendom
