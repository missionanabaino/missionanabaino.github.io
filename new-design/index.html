                    <h2>The Post-Christendom Challenge</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="content-body">
                    <p>Mission Anabaino emerged from a thirty-plus year
                        post-Christendom context in North America, specifically
                        New England - arguably the
                        "least religious region of North America." In this
                        environment, our deepest convictions are often not
                        acknowledged or respected. The words "God" and "Church"
                        are frequently treated as relics of the past.

                        <p>Yes, like other post-Christendom places, our birthing
                            grounds of New England are desperate for more
                            churches. But even more so, post-Christendom places
                            need a "new kind" of church! This has become MA's
                            area of expertise. Over the years, it was discovered
                            that the Christendom-model of planting churches most
                            common in our denominational contexts was just not
                            adequate. It often led to disillusionment and false
                            expectations for our church planters. It also failed
                            to reflect a strategy suitable to truly "scratch"
                            plants.</p>

                        <h2>Our Response</h2>

                        <p>We recognize the need for not just more churches, but
                            a "new kind" of church that can effectively engage
                            with and minister to a post-Christendom society. We
                            aim to rediscover the sacred first principles of the
                            apostolic missionary church. We translate these
                            principles into social liturgies that address
                            post-modernity challenges. We reconstruct the
                            pre-modern, apostolic church for a post-Christendom
                            context.</p>

                                "church" such as to then reconstruct the
                                pre-modern, apostolic church in a way that can
                                faithfully be translated into a post-Christendom
