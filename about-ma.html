                    Mission Anabaino is a network of churches and individuals
                    who are dedicated to planting churches, supporting the
                    growth of the church planting movement, and connecting with
                    other like-minded people.

                <h1>Become a Planeter</h1>
                <p>At Mission Anabaino, we believe that during His ascension
                    ministry today, Christ has an address at every place where
                    there is an apostolic, Christ-centered church. Mission
                    Anabaino consist of a growing number of affiliate churches
                    and partners wherein MA is gathering, energizing, deploying,
                    and focusing our resources into a collaborative effort to
                    plant churches where Christ's saving presence is not readily
                    accessible especially targeting post-christendom places.

                <p>
                    MA was initially blessed by God through Christ Presbyterian
                    Church, New Haven with $3.5 million venture capital with a
                    vision to plant 10 church in Southern CT, 10 Chuch Globally
                    in TEN YEARS! Going on nine years, MA has to date being
                    enabled to plant 24 churches and is planning for at least
                    two more in Southern Connecticut. At the same time, more and
                    more church planters from around the country, and even the
                    world, are contacting us, seeking to become theological
                    collaborators in misisonal ecclesiology and church planters
                    with Mission Anabaino.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In light of these developments, we launching MA 2.0. MA 2.0
                    will become a 501 (c)(3) organization governed and supported
                    by a network of member churches and supported by anchor
                    churches. We are currently seeking to recruite potential
                    Member and Anchor Churches who share the MA theological
                    vision and missional call to plant church suitable to
                    post-Christian and spiritually frontier regions of the
                    world- MA's specialty.
