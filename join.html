        <h1>How to Get Involved</h1>
        <h3>
          There are many ways you may participate in church planting with MA
        </h3>
        <h2>Recommend a Site for Church Planting!</h2>
        <p>
          You can help us by recommending a site either locally in the greater
          New Haven area or in other states or areas around the world that are
          in need of a Total Christ church planting movement. Do you yourself
          not -- or do you know of individuals who do not -- have easy access to
          a healthy Christ-centered congregation? Please let us know!
        </p>
        <h2>
          Help Gather a Church Planting Launch Team, or Join One of Our Existing
          Church Planting Launch Teams!
        </h2>
        <p>
          Would you like to get in on the ground level of planting a local
          presence of Christ? An essential ingredient is the presence and
          persistence of a dedicated core group committed to the long term
          future of the church. Contact Preston Graham
        </p>
        <h2>Help Establish or Join One of Our Local Collaboratives</h2>
        <p>
          Each month, local collaborators get together for worship and a "four
          movement" Prayer Service (Praise, Confession, Renewal, Benediction);
          followed by a time of theological collaboration reflecting on a shared
          reading around the broad topic of "missional
          ecclesiology"/"Christology applied"; which is then followed by a time
          of practical ministry collaboration; all while enjoying coffee and a
          catered lunch together. Collaborators consist of lead anchor church
          pastor(s), all lead mission church planters, their respective
          associate/assistant pastors, and invited like-minded pastors from
          local area churches/church plants. Presently the New Haven Local
          Collaborative meets monthly, and a number of regions are in the
          process of potentially beginning their own Local Collaborative. See
          Establishing a Mission Anabaino Local Collaborative.

          Become a Mission Anabaino Mission Church Planter, or Church Plant
          Ministry Staff Member, Yourself!
        </h2>
        <p>
          MA Mission Churches embrace the Total Christ, Five Mark Vision in
          missional ecclesiology; participate fully in the MA Collaborations;
          and are funded by MA, receiving one of three types of MA grants:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>Potential Anchor Church Planting Grant</span>
            <p>
              This grant is given to a church plant that is located in a
              strategic location and with a view toward leading a local movement
              of daughter churches/multi-congregational church, and forming a
              local collaborative. Typically, a portion of the total amount is
              allocated to the first daughter church and is dispersed in a 3-4
              year timetable.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Local Church Planting Grant</span>
            <p>
              This grant is given to a church plant that is located in a
              strategic location of an existing anchor church and is dispersed
              in a 3-4 year timetable.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Collaboration Grant</span>
            <p>
              This grant is given to all MA mission churches, approved recruits
              and/or valued MA associates to cover expenses associated with
              participating in the MA annual collaborative.
            </p>

        <h2>Receive Our Quarterly "MA Update"</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout the year the Executive Director of MA gives a brief report,
          together with one of our Global or Local (Southern Connecticut) church
          planters. If you would like to review previous MA update, you may see
          them here. If you would like to start receiving them directly, please
          click here and select the "Mission Anabaino" option.
        </p>
        <h2>Partner with Us in Prayer and Financial Support!</h2>
        <p>
          Prayer: In 1 John 5:14-15, we are reminded that when we ask anything
          that is according to God’s will, that God answers, using our prayers
          as one of the means to accomplish his will! We are assured in
          scripture that church planting is God’s will, even as the specifics
          are left to God’s continued wisdom. Please pray for Mission Anabaino –
          that it will be about Christ, his glory, his life giving presence and
          his harvest on earth as in heaven!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Support: We also know that Paul wrote perhaps his greatest treatise on
          the gospel, at least in part, as a support letter in his vision to
          plant churches in the unreached area of Spain “by way of you” (Rom.
          1:8-15, 15:14-29). Ever since, church planting has been “by way of”
          (Rom 15:28) those who are willing to invest their time, talent, and
          treasure. For mor information, please contact our Mission Anabaino
          Administrator (admin@cpcnewhaven.org). If interested you may give
          online or by check mailed to and made out to Christ Presbyterian
          Church New Haven with “Mission Anabaino” in the memo, at 135 Whitney
          Ave, New Haven, CT 06510.
